# Homework 1
smallest.java - Write an application that finds the smallest of several integers. Assume that the first value read in specifies the number of values to input from the user. 

max15.java - Write an application that uses a loop to calculate the product of odd integers from 1 to 15.   

oddNumbers.java - Now ammend your application to allow the user to specify the range to calculate.

# Homework 2

Implement the following integer or float methods:
  
  1. Method celsius returns the celsius equivalent of a fahrenheit temperature. 
    celsius = 5.0 / 9.0 * (fahrenheit - 32)
  
  2. Method fahrenheit returns the fahrenheit equibalent of a celsius temperature.
    fahrenheit = 9.0 / 5.0 * celsius + 32
  
  3. Use methods a & b above to write an application that enables the user either to enter a fahrenheit 
     temperature and display the celsius equivalent or vice versa.

Please note: this assignment will only generate one java file.  
  That file should have three methods main()   
  Where all input and output occurs celsius() & fahrenheit()   
  Which convert the temperature and return the results.  
  No input or output occurs in these methods
